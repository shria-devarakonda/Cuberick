# Cuberick
Aesthetically pleasing and oh so very sophisticated game made on Unity with C#. Just 3 levels. *Enjoy*. :godmode:

You'll find the .exe in the "**game**" folder. You can add to this game if you'd like, ~~not that that is needed~~. 

>I might work on this some more.<

What you need to know:
- ***A and D*** or ***Right and Left arrow keys to move***
-Yes this is my first unity game and yes it's based on *that* tutorial.
-If you want to add to this, you're welcome to collaborate.
-***Subscribe*** to my youtube channel where I killed like 5 people with a Junkrat ult. [ LINK ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPoRRxnoDRkP0KUtAKTFsrA)
